# iVisuals
 Hobby project for overlays applicable for iRacing. Purpose of this project is for me to learn a bit more about the iRacing api and also as a hobby project and I will be adding more stuff as time goes by. All you need to do is run main.py and making sure that an iRacing session is active. Plan on adding as much stuff as possible even though I might not need everything.
